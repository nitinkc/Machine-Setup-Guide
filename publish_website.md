# Publish Website

Publish your website by keeping the index.html of the project in the directory /var/www/html.

If the Port Forwarding is set to Port 80 in the Router, you can access the website using your IP Address from any where in the world.

eg: http://67.170.249.191

Using DDNS service, you can register this IP address with a Domain Name String.
