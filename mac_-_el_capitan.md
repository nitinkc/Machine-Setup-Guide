# MAC - El Capitan

Mac's Kernel is Linux Based. Thus learning to work with Linux/Mac based machine will enable you to work with almost all types of Linux Based OS's!!

For Fedora based and Debian Based Machine, except for the difference in the Package Manager and some other subtleties, Rest of the Things remains the same.

I will continue adding resources as I move along with using new systems.
